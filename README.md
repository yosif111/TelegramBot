# TelegramBot
A sentient telegram bot that classifies incoming messages (or messages in a group where the bot is a member of) into negative, positive or neutral and replies to the messages accordingly.

It was made as a part of a Laravel workshop that I tutored to members of "Future Technology Club" in King Saud University.
